Interaction Programing - Lab assignment2 - HTML
=================================================

In the present state of our Lab2 assigntment. We integrated the 4 views into the index.html file. But the dishdetail page hasn't been integrated because it needs us to create button for the picture. We will fix this problem further.
The steps to check the views: create new plan->confirm dinner->print full recipe

To hide or show the views, we use controllers to make the button clickable.
In the "selectdish" view, we use observers on the minus and plus button to change the amout of people. The number of guest amout will change dynamically and the total cost will also change.
